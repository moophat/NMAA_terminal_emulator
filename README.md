# NMAA_terminal_emulator
Brainstorming ideas to continue Gateone legacy


It's fucking 2025
Despite being nearly a decade old (last commit ~2016), GateOne still outperforms most "modern" web-based terminals in key areas

| Feature                            | GateOne                                   | Modern Alternatives (Wetty, ttyd, GoTTY, Tabby, Xterm.js, etc.) |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multiple sessions/tabs**         | ✅ Built-in tabbed sessions                | ❌ Mostly 1:1 session (Wetty), or basic multiplex                |
| **Session persistence**            | ✅ Via HMAC + encryption                   | ⚠️ Often stateless or requires hacks                            |
| **Terminal recording/replay**      | ✅ Native recording/playback               | ❌ Rare or non-existent                                          |
| **Plugin system (JS/Python)**      | ✅ Rich plugin system (e.g., SSH, logging) | ❌ Minimal or none                                               |
| **Security (HTTPS, CSP, sandbox)** | ✅ SSL, audit trails, detailed ACLs        | ⚠️ Basic TLS (if at all), poor session auth                     |
| **Performance**                    | ⚡ Fast even over slow links               | ⚠️ Latency varies, often sluggish                               |
| **User isolation**                 | ✅ Multi-user aware                        | ❌ Typically per-session, not multi-user ready                   |
| **Clipboard + file drag/drop**     | ✅ Implemented well pre-2016               | ❌ Still buggy or missing in many tools                          |


The tragedy?

* GateOne **requires Tornado**, Python 2/early 3, and its JS is slowly rotting.
* The ecosystem never adopted it fully, likely due to **complexity** and **lack of container-friendly integration**.

Everyone focuses on embedding `xterm.js` on top of React and shit, and calling it a day — usually **stateless, insecure, non-persistent**, and lacking audit/logging.

Let's see if the AI can do it
